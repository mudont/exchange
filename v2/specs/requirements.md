# Requirements Document - Trading Exchange Platform v2

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern TypeScript-based trading/betting exchange platform that replaces the existing Python Django system. The platform will support multiple authentication methods, real-time trading, and provide a secure, scalable foundation for financial trading operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Provider Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to register and login using Google, Facebook, or email/password, so that I can access the trading platform conveniently and securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display options for Google, Facebook, and email registration
2. WHEN a user registers with email THEN the system SHALL send a verification email before account activation
3. WHEN a user clicks the email verification link THEN the system SHALL activate their account and redirect to login
4. WHEN a user registers with Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL create an account using their Google profile information
5. WHEN a user registers with Facebook OAuth THEN the system SHALL create an account using their Facebook profile information
6. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate accounts and show appropriate error message
7. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL issue a secure JWT token with appropriate expiration
8. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to login page

### Requirement 2: Real-time Trading Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to place buy/sell orders that are matched in real-time with other traders, so that I can execute trades efficiently at fair market prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user places a limit order THEN the system SHALL validate the order parameters and add it to the order book
2. WHEN an incoming order matches existing orders THEN the system SHALL execute trades using price-time priority
3. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL update both orders' filled quantities and create a trade record
4. WHEN an order is fully filled THEN the system SHALL mark the order status as COMPLETED
5. WHEN an order partially fills THEN the system SHALL update the filled quantity and keep the order active
6. WHEN orders are matched THEN the system SHALL ensure atomic database transactions to prevent inconsistent state
7. WHEN the system processes orders THEN it SHALL prevent race conditions using proper locking mechanisms
8. WHEN a user cancels an order THEN the system SHALL remove it from the order book if still active

### Requirement 3: Real-time Market Data Distribution

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to see live order book updates, trade executions, and my order status changes, so that I can make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the platform THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time updates
2. WHEN the order book changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to all subscribed clients within 100ms
3. WHEN a trade executes THEN the system SHALL immediately notify all relevant users of the trade details
4. WHEN a user's order status changes THEN the system SHALL send a real-time notification to that user
5. WHEN a user subscribes to an instrument THEN the system SHALL send the current order book snapshot
6. WHEN the WebSocket connection drops THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
7. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL efficiently broadcast updates without performance degradation
8. WHEN a user unsubscribes from an instrument THEN the system SHALL stop sending updates for that instrument

### Requirement 4: Account and Position Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to view my account balance, open positions, and trading history, so that I can track my performance and manage risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display their current account balance and available funds
2. WHEN a user has open positions THEN the system SHALL show real-time P&L calculations
3. WHEN a user places an order THEN the system SHALL check sufficient balance before accepting the order
4. WHEN a trade executes THEN the system SHALL update the user's position and balance immediately
5. WHEN a user views trading history THEN the system SHALL display all their trades with filtering options
6. WHEN calculating P&L THEN the system SHALL use current market prices for mark-to-market valuation
7. WHEN a user exceeds risk limits THEN the system SHALL prevent new orders and alert the user
8. WHEN positions are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate audit trails

### Requirement 5: Instrument Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to create and manage trading instruments with proper parameters, so that users can trade on various markets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates an instrument THEN the system SHALL validate all required parameters (symbol, price limits, tick size)
2. WHEN an instrument is created THEN the system SHALL initialize an empty order book for that instrument
3. WHEN an instrument expires THEN the system SHALL prevent new orders and settle existing positions
4. WHEN instrument parameters are updated THEN the system SHALL validate changes don't break existing orders
5. WHEN an instrument is deactivated THEN the system SHALL cancel all open orders and notify affected users
6. WHEN users query instruments THEN the system SHALL return only active, non-expired instruments
7. WHEN displaying instruments THEN the system SHALL show current best bid/ask prices
8. WHEN an instrument reaches expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically settle positions at the closing price

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal and financial data to be secure and protected, so that I can trade with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data in transit using HTTPS
2. WHEN storing user passwords THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds
3. WHEN handling JWT tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure signing algorithms and appropriate expiration times
4. WHEN users access API endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate authentication and authorization
5. WHEN logging system events THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive information like passwords or tokens
6. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms
7. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL comply with data protection regulations
8. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose internal system details to users

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle high trading volumes and concurrent users efficiently, so that the platform remains responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing orders THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 orders per second
2. WHEN multiple users connect THEN the system SHALL support at least 10,000 concurrent WebSocket connections
3. WHEN querying order books THEN the system SHALL respond within 50ms for 95% of requests
4. WHEN the database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain performance through proper indexing
5. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally without data loss
6. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies
7. WHEN memory usage grows THEN the system SHALL implement proper garbage collection and memory management
8. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for response times, throughput, and error rates

### Requirement 8: API Design and Integration
